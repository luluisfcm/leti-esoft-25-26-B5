# US 22 - Register the arrival of an SNS user

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As Receptionist, I want to register the arrival of an SNS user at the vaccination center to take
the vaccine.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

> When an SNS user arrives at the vaccination center, the receptionist registers the arrival so the user can proceed to vaccination according to the operational flow.

**From the client clarifications:**
> **Question:** Can the arrival of an SNS user only be registered if there is a prior appointment scheduled for that day?  
> **Answer:** Yes, the arrival of an SNS user can only be registered if there is a previously scheduled appointment for that day and for the same vaccination center. This ensures that no arrivals without prior scheduling are allowed.

> **Question:** What is created in the system when an arrival is registered?  
> **Answer:** When the arrival is registered, the system must create an event or state that represents the SNS user's check-in. This record is required to fulfill the acceptance criteria (AC22-1 and AC22-2).

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC22-1:** No duplicate entries should be possible for the same SNS user on the same day.
- **AC22-2:** The SNS user should be assigned to the waiting room.
- **AC22-3:** The arrival can only be registered if there is a scheduled appointment for the same day and vaccination center.


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- There is a dependency with **[US21](../US21/US21.md) – Schedule a vaccine administration**, since the arrival of an SNS user can only be registered if there is a **previous appointment scheduled for the same day and the same vaccination center**.  
  
### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

- Typed data:
  - SNS user number
- Selected data:
  - Vaccination center

**Output Data:**

- (In)success of the operation
- Check-in confirmation data:
  - Check-in identifier
  - Appointment identifier
  - Assigned waiting room
  - Arrival date and time

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

* Registering an arrival creates a check-in record associated with the SNS user's appointment and assigned waiting room.


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

![US22-DM](svg/US22-DM.svg)

### 2.2. Other Remarks

- The concepts `CheckIn` and `WaitingRoom` were introduced in the domain model to explicitly represent the SNS user's arrival at a vaccination center, as clarified by the client.
- A `CheckIn` is associated with at most one `Appointment`, which supports the prevention of duplicate arrivals on the same day (AC22-1), and it is linked to a `WaitingRoom` to support waiting room assignment (AC22-2).


## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for… | Answer | Justification (with patterns) |
|:--------------:|:-------------------------------------------|:-------|:------------------------------|
| Step 1 | interacting with the actor (Receptionist)? | RegisterArrivalView | **Pure Fabrication** for UI interaction; isolates the UI from domain logic. |
|  | receiving the system operation to start the use case (register arrival)? | RegisterArrivalController | **GRASP Controller**: first object to receive the system operation for this use case. |
| Step 2 | requesting the SNS user number and the vaccination center from the actor? | RegisterArrivalView | **Pure Fabrication**: responsible for collecting input data from the actor. |
| Step 3 | collecting the provided data (snsUserNumber and vaccinationCenter) to send to the controller/service? | RegisterArrivalRequest (DTO) | **Parameter Object / Pure Fabrication**: aggregates input data into a single object passed across layers. |
|  | obtaining today’s scheduled appointment for the given SNS user and vaccination center? | AppointmentRepository | **Information Expert**: stores and retrieves `Appointment` entities and supports queries such as “today’s appointment”. |
| Step 4 | presenting the scheduled appointment and requesting check-in confirmation? | RegisterArrivalView | **Pure Fabrication**: presents system information and collects confirmation from the actor. |
| Step 5 | validating that arrival can be registered (appointment exists and no duplicate check-in) (AC22-1)? | ArrivalService | **Information Expert** for business rules: encapsulates arrival constraints and prevents duplicate arrivals on the same day. |
|  | obtaining the waiting room for the selected vaccination center (AC22-2)? | WaitingRoomRepository | **Information Expert**: provides access to waiting room data associated with a `VaccinationCenter`. |
|  | creating and persisting the check-in record? | ArrivalService / CheckInRepository | **Creator** (ArrivalService) creates the `CheckIn` using required data; **Pure Fabrication** (CheckInRepository) persists it. |
| Step 6 | informing the actor about operation success or failure? | RegisterArrivalView | **Pure Fabrication**: provides user feedback while keeping business logic in the service layer. |


### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

- SNSUser
- Appointment
- VaccinationCenter
- WaitingRoom
- CheckIn

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

- RegisterArrivalView
- RegisterArrivalController
- ArrivalService
- AppointmentRepository
- WaitingRoomRepository
- CheckInRepository
- RepositoryFactory
- RegisterArrivalRequest (DTO)

## 6. Integration and Demo

A menu option on the console application was added. Such option invokes the UpdateCategoryView.

    int CategoriesMenuView::processMenuOption(int option) {
        int result = 0;
        BaseView * view;
        switch (option) {
          ...
          case 3:
            view = new UpdateCategoryView(this->userToken);
            view->show();
            break;
          ...
        }
        return result;
    }
